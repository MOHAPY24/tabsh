This doc serves as a guide to translating English commands to Arabic, and writing
them down.

## General info

Translations are written in the "translations.py" in tabsh/. They are written in
a Python dictionary, and as key:value pairs.  Translations are formatted as so:

commands = {
	"<arabic translation 1>": "<original english command 1>",
	"<arabic translation 2>": "<original english command 2>" <-- Note how there is no comma in the
}                                                                    last entry.

## Tips

1. Arabic is a lingustically painful language to mix two words the same
   way English does for these commands. If you need to translate a command
   like "hyperctl" for example, don't hesitate to add a dash between the two
   words in Arabic (the prefix "هايبر" and the suffix "تحكم", making "هايبر-تحكم").

2. It's fine if you want to translate a command verbosely, but please don't overdo it.
   TABSH is meant to be a way for Arabic beginners to experience Bash in a user
   friendly way, so if you don't capture the meaning of a command in one word, you can
   extend it to 2-3 words. But do NOT make it a chore to type in a single command, as
   most Arabic people (even I lol) feel like it is tiring to type in large amounts of
   text.
