This folder is meant to showcase research/improvements documents about TABSH. If you have encountered issues and/or made improvements,
it's recommended to write a .txt about it. This folder can also function as a holder for your TODOs and reminders. Feel free to create
your own folder with your name, within the Contributors folder!
