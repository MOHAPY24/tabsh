    # Helpful reminders for all translation contributors:
    
    # 1. Arabic is a lingustically painful language to mix two words the same
    #    way English does for these commands. If you need to translate a command 
    #    like "hyperctl" for example, don't hesitate to add a dash between the two
    #    words in Arabic (the prefix "هايبر" and the suffix "تحكم", making "هايبر-تحكم"). 

    # 2. It's fine if you want to translate a command verbosely, but please don't overdo it.
    #    TABSH is meant to be a way for Arabic beginners to experience Bash in a user
    #    friendly way, so if you don't capture the meaning of a command in one word, you can
    #    extend it to 2-3 words. But do NOT make it a chore to type in a single command, as
    #    most Arabic people (even I lol) feel like it is tiring to type in large amounts of
    #    text.
